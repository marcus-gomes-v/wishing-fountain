            <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>
          </h2>

          <p className="mt-4 text-[24px] text-gray-600">
            With their limitless imagination and pure innocence, it's an exceptional trait for children at this young age to dream without boundaries. Our workshop is an opportunity to resonate with this fertile imagination, empower our little dreamers and give them encouragement to express and bring their dreams to life.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Duration:</strong> Approximately an hour
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Objective:</strong> This workshop is designed to invite children to recognize, articulate, and pictorially represent their dreams in a fun, engaging, and encouraging environment.
            <br /><br />

                <strong>Setting the Stage (5 minutes):</strong> Begin with an inspiring real-life story of a person who realized their childhood dream, like an astronaut who dreamt of space, or an artist inspired by nature. Pose the question, "What do you think a dream is?"

            </li>
            <li>

              <ul className="list-disc pl-12 text-[24px]">
                <li className="py-2">"Imagine you've woken up with a superpower! What would it be? How would you use this power to do wonderful things in the world?"</li>
                <li className="py-2">"Pretend you are an inventor and you can create something amazing that the world has never seen. What would your invention do to make everyone's life better?"</li>
                <li className="py-2">"Think about a day where we all lend a helping hand to each other. What help could you give to make someone's day brighter?"</li>
                <li className="py-2">"If you could grow a magical tree that does something special for humans, what would that special thing be? How would people feel after using your magical tree?"</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>

                <strong>Dream Visualization Activity (20 minutes):</strong> Distribute art supplies and encourage children to bring their dreams to life on paper. This could be responses to prompts or any fantastical idea they have. Play calming instrumental tunes in the background to create a serene ambiance.
